        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Phoebe Lam and I am currently a Pre-Business 
        undergraduate student at the University of California-Riverside, with a 
        3.66 GPA as of the end of the Fall 2019 quarter. I plan to concentrate in 
        either Marketing or Finance, looking to explore in both fields or maybe 
        integrate the two in my future career. Experience in both would propel me 
        closer to my current ambitions of becoming an entrepreneur. While I do not 
        have paid work experience, I have a lot of volunteer experience that have 
        helped me to gain both soft and hard skills essential in completing any 
        task at hand. 
<br><br>

        I am extremely adaptable and organized, which came in handy during my time 
        in the Placentia Teen Advisory Council. All events and fundraisers were 
        catered to the Placentia population of all ages, so it was important to 
        choose the proper location, date, and time best to maximize turnout and 
        profit. For example, we held a fundraiser for the Placentia public library 
        in the park the day a concert was scheduled. Originally, we were going to 
        have the fundraising event in front of the library on a random Saturday 
        because the library garnered the most patrons on Saturday. However, I suggested
        to switch it around because while there may have been a lot of people, not 
        enough would purchase the food/drink items at our booth. But at a concert, 
        the influx of hungry and thirsty concert-goers was much higher. But my proposition 
        proved to be more challenging because it required more time and effort to 
        select a location that wasn't our primary. The library was the Council's 
        go-to due to convenience and significantly more available employees and 
        volunteers. Therefore, some didn't agree with me. But I was able to encourage 
        my peers to carry out our mission with the same rigor as before and our 
        event turned out to be a profitable success.
<br><br>
        
        In addition, I have strong communication skills, which I can attribute to 
        both my time in the Advisory Council and at the St. Jude Medical Center. 
        At St. Jude's, I worked a 3-hour shift every Friday (one of the busier days), 
        handling both visitors and patients. I checked visitors in and guided them 
        to the right rooms, if needed. I also retrieved wheelchairs and discharged 
        patients from any part of the hospital. Being around so many different people 
        really opened my mind to the different thoughts, beliefs, outlooks, and 
        behaviors each person has. The constant interaction with St. Jude patrons 
        and cooperation with fellow volunteers gave me an idea of what kind of work 
        life I wanted. The ideal work place for me would promote teamwork and frequent 
        communication with others. I thrive best in proactive environments. 
<br><br>
        
        However, I have also worked in quieter environments, such as when I was 
        an intern at the University of California-Irvine. The majority of the internship
        was preparing to assist carrying out a lab on electro-acupuncture. I attended 
        lectures and eventually was able to have a small part in the research lab. 
        And while this internship had nothing to do with my choice discipline, I 
        found that I also enjoyed studious circumstances; this was not necessarily 
        due to the serenity of the internship, but largely because I was able to 
        learn a lot from it. While I am not a big fan of science, I am a big fan 
        of acquiring knowledge. Time is limited and I'd like it best if I could 
        use my time to absorb all that I can because all knowledge is useful knowledge 
        at one point or another.
<br><br>

        Being a student, I can only say that I want to best utilize that time and 
        find ways to not only improve myself, but to be of service to the community 
        as well. One thing in common among my past volunteer experiences is that, 
        no matter how different they may seem, they were all geared towards community. 
        My goal is to provide my best efforts to benefit as many people as possible, 
        especially since I am able to consider all points of view and can work well 
        with anyone, even those whom I may not concur with. I have the expertise 
        imperative in undertaking any endeavor and hope to build that expertise.
